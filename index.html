    <h2 style="color:whitesmoke;">About Me</h2>
    <p style="color:whitesmoke;">This is Yash Srivastava and I
        am pursuing B.Tech (CSE) from GLA University.
        I belong to Renukoot and I have done my
        schooling from there.
        I am a state-level swimmer and a
        professional guitarist and apart from this,
        I am a Graphic designer as well.
        I choose Computer Science because
        I am always curious to know more about
        this technology.</p>
